<h1> THANKFULNESS</h1>

Heavenly Father; <br> 
The Most High: <br> 
And Lofty One;  <br>
One in the One  <br>
Supreme Deity:  <br>
I thank you,  <br>
For who you are… <br> 
Always ready,  <br>
To assure us…  <br>
Of your goodness,<br> 
And your mercy…  <br>
Thank you, Father:  <br>
That I am always,  <br>
A recipient…  <br>
Of your faithfulness, <br> 
My life is nothing…  <br>
Without you, O’Lord,  <br>
Compassionate and forgiving: <br>
I ask that you keep me,  <br>
On the right path…  <br>
And when I fail,,  <br>
Please forgive me my weakness… <br> 
And lead me home.  <br>
In Jesus’ name I pray , <br>
The wonderful counselor,  <br>
The prince of peace , <br>
Emanuel, Emanuel:  <br>
His spirit of truth,  <br>
The divine teacher,  <br>
The great comforter,  <br>
The Mighty Holy Spirit… <br>
I give thanks,  <br>
To the most High; <br> 
His son…  For acknowledgement:  <br>
In answering my prayers. <br>
AMEN!<br>
