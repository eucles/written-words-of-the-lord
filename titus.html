<h1>Titus 2:2</h1>


<p>
<pre>
Lord, help me, 
live in a way, 
that others see, 
You in me. 
Make me sound minded, 
having solid faith, 
and patient. 
Let me be giving, 
and generous, 
with my possessions and time. 
I pray for, 
the older men, 
in my church. 
-That the aged men ,
-be sober, grave, temperate, 
-sound in faith, in charity, 
-and in patience.
Conform them to Your character. 
Keep growing and maturing them, 
until they walk their, 
last day with You. 
Every day I want, 
to remain sober,
pray to be a, 
man of good character,
to use good judgment, 
and to be well-grounded, 
in faith, love, and endurance.
Thank You for Your instruction, 
In Jesus' name. 
I pray,
Amen.
