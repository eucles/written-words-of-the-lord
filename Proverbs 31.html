<h1>Proverbs 31:30</h1>


<p>

Precious Father, I thank You, <br>
for the woman, <br>
that brought me, <br>
into this world, my mother. <br>
-Favour is deceitful, -<br>
-and beauty is vain: -<br>
-but a woman that, -<br>
-feareth the LORD, -<br>
-she shall be praised.-<br>
he reminds men to admire, <br>
the heart above beauty, <br>
because that is what pleases God,<br>
The Lord, looks not at appearances, <br>
but at the heart.<br>
Without You and without her, <br>
I would not be here today.<br>
A beautiful woman may not be *honest. <br>
And she may not, <br>
be beautiful when she is old.<br>
But all men speak well, <br>
about a woman who is afraid of the *Lord.<br>
Praying that I encounter more women, <br>
that have a strong belief in You. <br>
He reminds us that outward, <br>
appearances do not last, <br>
and the charm of beauty, <br>
can mislead us. So he invites, <br>
women to pursue an enduring, <br>
reverence for the Lord above beauty.<br>
I know that no matter, <br>
the gender, any person, <br>
with a power and love for You, <br>
is one that I would want around me, <br>
I pray that I discover, <br>
more of them soon. <br>
In Jesus' name,<br>
I pray.<br>
Amen.<br>
