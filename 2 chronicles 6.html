<h1>2 chronicles 6:18</h1>

<p>


O Lord, you are the omni- <br>
You are everywhere- <br>
present God.<br>
heaven and the heaven of heavens, <br>
cannot contain thee; <br>
how much less, <br>
this house which I have built!<br>
no not the entirety, <br>
of the created universe. <br>
The universe is vast, <br>
beyond our ability, <br>
to comprehend, <br>
yet as a created thing, <br>
we know it must have its limits. <br>
But you are infinite. <br>
Your divine nature is beyond, <br>
our ability to comprehend, <br>
and we feel our smallness.<br>
we also know, <br>
you dwell in us, <br>
your people, <br>
and hold intimate communion, <br>
with our spirits every day. <br>
In Jesus'name.<br>
I pray.<br>
Amen.<br>
