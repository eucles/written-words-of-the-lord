 THANKS BE TO GOD, WHO ALWAYS LEADS <BR>

AND THROUGH US SPREADS EVERYWHERE <BR>
THE FRAGRANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM<BR>

<pre>
Because iChoose to pursue my relationship with Jesus
He's making my gift a treasure, adding value to everything I value 
and increasing the value of everything he put into me
Because ichoose to pursue Him,
Yes I choose him over
everything else in my life, 
He's giving me clear directions
for the new year.
This year will be the best year of my life,
free from the typical, usual generational mistakes
that I use to be prone to make
to God be the glory!
For today I am free from every issue of blood
and from every generational curse, 
that's plagued my family
and held us back,
My life's assignment is to break my family through
and to strengthen, and extend our righteous legacy
In the name of jesus! So today I choose Jesus.
I choose you lord for my bloodline 
and every person connected to me,
please release The Blessing of The Lord,
In Jesus' name! Amen
