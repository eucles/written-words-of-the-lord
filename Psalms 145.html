<h1> Psalms 145:8 </h1>

<p>


Precious Lord, thank you,<br>
for Your great mercy. <br>
I rely on it every day. <br>
-The Lord is gracious, <br>
and full of compassion;-<br>
How full of *grace, <br>
and *mercy is the *LORD.<br>
God’s compassion, <br>
is such great news for us. <br>
How burdensome would life, <br>
be if God responded, <br>
with anger at every mistake.<br>
-God is slow to anger, <br>
and of great mercy.-<br>
I am grateful that You,<br>
hold back Your anger, <br>
even when I fail. <br>
It is with humility and awe, <br>
that I receive the mercy, <br>
of Your forgiveness. <br>
We’d be afraid to do anything, <br>
for fear of messing up.<br>
God answers our sins, <br>
our failures, and our, <br>
shortcomings with mercy. <br>
By His grace, He gently, <br>
restores us and corrects our course.<br>
He is slow to become angry, <br>
and is full of kind love.<br>
Thank you for the correction, <br>
that You provide to me each day. <br>
In Jesus’ name, <br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
