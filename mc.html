Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns 
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody 
in your heart to the Lord;
Giving thanks always for all things 
unto God and the Father 
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Submitting yourselves 
one to another 
in the fear of God.
Wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields) 
submit yourselves unto your own 
husband- (Reginald A Taylor), 
as unto the Lord.
For the husband-(Reginald A Taylor) 
is the head of the wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields), 
even as Christ is the head of the church: 
and he is the saviour of the body.
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, 
so let the wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields) 
be to their own husband-(Reginald A Taylor) 
in every thing.
Husband-(Reginald A Taylor), 
love your wife, even as Christ 
also loved the church, 
and gave himself for it;
That he might sanctify and cleanse 
it with the washing of water by the word,
That he might present it to himself 
a glorious church, 
not having spot, or wrinkle, 
or any such thing; 
but that it should be holy and without blemish.
So ought man-(Reginald A Taylor) 
to love their wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields) 
as their own bodies. 
He that loveth his wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields) 
loveth himself.
For no man ever yet 
hated his own flesh; 
but nourisheth and cherisheth it, 
even as the Lord did the church:
For we are members of his body, 
of his flesh, and of his bones.
For this cause shall a man-(Reginald A Taylor) 
leave his father and mother, 
and shall be joined unto his wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields), 
and they two shall be one flesh.
This is a great mystery: 
but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Nevertheless let every one of you 
in particular so love his wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields)
even as himself-(Reginald A Taylor); 
and the wife-(Joycelyn Willis Fields) 
see that she reverence her husband-(Reginald A Taylor).
