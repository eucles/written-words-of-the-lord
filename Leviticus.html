<h1>Leviticus 19:10</h1>

<p>


Lord, thank You for meeting <br>
my needs so fully and completely. <br>
"And thou shalt not <br>
glean(extract) thy vineyard, "<br>
Please help to remember <br>
that everything I have <br>
is a gift from You. <br>
"neither shalt thou gather, <br>
every grape of thy vineyard; "<br>
-neither shalt thou gather,<br> 
the fallen fruit of thy vineyard;-<br>
Give me eyes to see,<br>
the people around me ,<br>
that need help, <br>
"thou shalt leave them ,<br>
for the poor and stranger: <br>
I am the Lord your God."<br>
-thou shalt leave them,<br>
for the poor and for the sojourner: <br>
I am Jehovah your God.-<br>
so that I can pass, <br>
on a portion of, <br>
Your bounty to others.<br> 
Work through my gifts, <br>
so that Your grace, <br>
can be seen and Your love, <br>
can be experienced by those, <br>
You have called me to help. <br>
In Jesusâ€™ Name, <br>
Amen.<br>
