<h1>Stay My Hand</h1>


<p>
Father in heaven,<br> 
my heart's weighs greatly,<br>
As I read your word,<br>
In search of guidance,<br>
I know in Genesis 3,<br>
My eyes were opened to sin,<br>
And sometimes I can't help myself to sin,<br>
Father I do not want to live my life cursed,<br>
As did my ancestors,<br>
I want to know who you are in abundance,<br>
You word is so vast and complicated,<br>
I'm afraid that I lose myself, <br>
in your many parables.<br>
Of the many different examples,<br>
Of your truth, grace and goodness,<br>
I ask that you guide me, <br>
away from evil thoughts.<br>
That often seek to destroy me,<br>
I ask that you forgive me, <br>
of each and every past,<br>
Sin that I have caused upon others,<br>
I ask that you renew in me, <br>
a spirit of love and truth.<br>
Please heavenly father hear my prayers,<br>
So that I maybe able to go out in this world,<br>
To share your awesome message, <br>
you have given,<br> 
unto me, please lord grant me, <br>
the wisdom you so, gracefully, <br>
granted to Solomon.<br>
I ask this in Jesus'name,<br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
