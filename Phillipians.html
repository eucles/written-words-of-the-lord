<h1>Phillipians 4:9</h1>



<p>


Dear God, I ask,<br>
that as I learn ,<br>
about more of ,<br>
you and your ways, <br>
-May I do those things,<br> 
that I learned from you.-<br>
The things that we see and hear, <br>
in the Word of God, <br>
and through the different teachers. <br>
You have sent to guide us, <br>
we are to apply the word of god,<br>
in our daily lives.<br>
may I not just be a hearer, <br>
of the word but a doer, <br>
of the word too. <br>
You said O'Lord, <br>
-remember the things that I said. <br>
Remember the things that I did. <br>
You must do those things too!-<br>
May evidence of your ways, <br>
be present in my life. <br>
-And so the God who causes, <br>
us to be without, <br>
trouble inside ourselves, <br>
will be with you.-<br>
When we apply this, <br>
knowledge in our lives. <br>
This is when the knowledge,<br>
will be truly become effective.<br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
