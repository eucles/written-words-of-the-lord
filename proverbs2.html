<h1>Proverbs 2:1-11</h1>


  <p>1 Learn what I teach you, my son. And never forget what I ask you to do.<br>
     2 Listen to my *wise words and try to understand them.<br>
     3 Yes, do not stop asking for *wise words. Do not stop asking until you understand.<br>
     4 Look for *wisdom as you would look for *silver. Look for it as for valuable stones that someone has hidden under the ground.<br>
     5 So you will know how to be afraid of the *Lord. And you will learn about God.<br>
     6 It is the *Lord who says *wise words. He helps us to understand the things that are too difficult for us. He helps us to know what we need to know.<br>
     7 He helps good people to be *wise. And he keeps *honest people safe.<br>
     8 He keeps people safe who are fair to other people. And he watches over those people who obey him.<br>
     9 Listen to me. So you will know what is right. You will know what are true and fair words. You will know what you should do.<br>
     10 You will become *wise. And you will have pleasure in the things that you understand.<br>
     11 Your good thoughts and the things that you understand will help you. They will be like someone who is watching over you to keep you safe.<br>
