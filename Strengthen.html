<h1>Strengthen</h1>


<p>

Lord, our strength, <br>
only comes from You. <br>
Give us strength, <br>
to be peaceful. <br>
And we shall stand and feed, <br>
in the strength of the LORD, <br>
Help us die to ourselves,<br>
in the majesty of the name, <br>
of the LORD our God, <br>
for the sake of others. <br>
You do not call us, <br>
to stir up strife,<br>
 and be hateful. <br>
 You call us to love others, <br>
 pray for them, <br>
 and to turn the other cheek. <br>
 Give me the strength to be like, <br>
 You in that way. <br>
 I will look to Jesus, <br>
 as the perfect example. <br>
 Thank You for being, <br>
 A God of peace. <br>
 In Jesus' name. <br>
 Amen.<br>
