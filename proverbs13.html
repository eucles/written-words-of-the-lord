<h1>PROVERBS 13:20</h1>


<p>
HE WHO WALKS WITH THE WISE GROW WISE <br>
BUT A COMPANION OF FOOLS SUFFER HARM <br>

<pre>
Father, I thank you
for breaking 
that needy spirit
off of my life!
I thank you
for teaching me how to be alone.
I can now appreciate 
solitude and peace, 
in my personal space
I praise you today
for walking me through
to this place
where I no longer
need to be needed
I no longer have to have people
around, just so I wont be alone
Today I confess
I am happy
with Jesus alone
I'm good even if it's just me and you
I'm content with just being with you
within the joy and safety of your presence
So my commitment
to you father and to myself
Is to be careful who and what I let ride this year
I get it  now, and I understand now
that its better to ride alone 
than to put people next to me
or behind me who aren't ready for me 
I hear you holy spirit and I know sometimes 
I just got to ride it out by myself
knowing I'll never be by myself
because you will never leave me alone
nor forsake me
In Jesus name, I pray
Amen.
</pre>
