O' LORD, <br>
MY VOICE SHALT, <br>
THOU HEAR, <br>
IN THE MORNING, <br>
LET US SEEK YOU, <br>
EARLY AT THE BEGINNING <br>
OF EVERYDAY; <br>
AND THROUGHOUT <br>
EVERYDAY, <br>
TILL ITâ€™S CLOSED. <br>
O'LORD, IN THE MORNING <br>
WILL I DIRECT MY PRAYER <br>
UNTO THEE, <br>
AND WILL LOOK UP; <br>
TO LIVE THAT DAY <br>
FOR YOU; AT NOON <br>
LET US MEASURE <br>
OUR PROGRESS MID-WAY <br>
IN THE EVENING; <br>
LET US REFLECT; <br>
ON HOW WELL; <br>
WE SUCCEEDED. <br>
IN THE NAME OF: <br>
LORD THY GOD: <br>
THE PRINCE OF PEACE: <br>
THE MIGHTY HOLY SPIRIT: <br>
AMEN. <br>
