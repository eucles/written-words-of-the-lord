<h1>Micah 5:4-5</h1>


<p>

Lord, our strength, <br>
only comes from You. <br>
-And he shall stand and feed -<br>
-in the strength of the LORD, -<br>
-in the majesty of the name -<br>
-of the LORD his God; -<br>
-and they shall abide: -<br>
-for now shall he be great -<br>
-unto the ends of the earth.-<br>
Give us strength to be peaceful. <br>
Help us die to ourselves, <br>
for the sake of others. <br>
Jesus would be the peace,<br>
Jesus certainly is the peace. <br>
He will rule with authority, <br>
from the *Lord his God, <br>
and his people will be safe. <br>
So then, all over the world, <br>
people will know that he is great,<br>
He is the bridge between God and man. <br>
There could not be peace, <br>
between us and God without Christ.<br>
And this ruler will stay strong, <br>
because the *Lord will make him strong. <br>
He will supply what his people need. <br>
He will be like a man, <br>
who supplies everything for his sheep. <br>
You do not call us, <br>
to stir up strife and be hateful. <br>
You call us to love others, <br>
pray for them, and to turn the other cheek.<br>
- for now shall he be great -<br>
 -unto the ends of the earth. -<br>
-And this man shall be the peace, -<br>
- when the Assyrian shall come -<br>
- into our land: and when -<br>
- he shall tread in our palaces, -<br>
- then shall we raise -<br>
 -against him seven shepherds, -<br>
 -and eight principal men.-<br>
Give me the strength,<br>
to be like You in that way. <br>
I will look to Jesus, <br>
as the perfect example of this. <br>
Jesus exampled peace during His life: <br>
He rebuked one of His disciples, <br>
for standing up for Him with a sword, <br>
and He did not fight against his captors, <br>
when He was about to be crucified. <br>
Jesus is our ultimate example, <br>
and source of peace.<br>
 he will cause the people to rest,<br>
 so that they have no trouble. <br>
 Assyria's soldiers will come, <br>
 to  our country. <br>
 They will march through, <br>
 our large, strong buildings. <br>
 Then we will choose seven, <br>
 or eight leaders to fight against them.<br>
Thank You for being, <br>
a God of peace. <br>
In Jesus' name. <br>
Amen.<br>
