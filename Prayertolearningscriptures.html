<h1>Prayer to help understand the bible</h1>


<p>


Lord Jesus, <br>
Father God,<br>
Holy Spirit, <br>
I thank you, <br>
that you have given, <br>
me a guide book, <br>
– a map – for how, <br>
to do life through your Word. <br>
I thank you that it is alive, <br>
and vibrant and timely. <br>
I thank you that through it, <br>
you speak directly into my life, <br>
providing wisdom, inspiring change, <br>
and refreshing my soul. <br>
Lord, as I open your Word today, <br>
I do so expectantly and with gratitude. <br>
I ask you now to take the wheel, <br>
and direct this time spent with you. <br>
Will you help me to hear you, <br>
and will you guide and direct, <br>
me to exactly the words and messages, <br>
I need to hear from you today, <br>
that will produce the greatest blessings, <br>
for me and those around me, <br>
and bring you the most glory. <br>
I thank you in advance, <br>
for revealing yourself to me, <br>
through your Word. <br>
In Jesus name,<br>
I pray, <br>
Amen.<br>
