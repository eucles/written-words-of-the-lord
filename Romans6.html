<h1>Romans 6:17</h1>


<p>

Our hearts, O Lord, <br>
were enslaved to sin, <br>
unable to respond in love to you.<br>
But now you have made, <br>
us alive to righteousness.<br>
-God be thanked, -<br>
-that ye were the servants of sin, -<br>
-but ye have obeyed,- <br>
-from the heart,- <br>
-that form of doctrine,- <br>
-which has delivered you.-<br>
Help us to continue, <br>
to obey you from the heart, <br>
and grow by the sanctifying power, <br>
of your Word. <br>
Only by obeying the Gospel, <br>
from the heart can we be saved.<br>
help me not to repeat praying, <br>
or walking down an aisle, <br>
at a religious event, <br>
cause that does not save me.<br>
Repent and believe! <br>
is what saves us. <br>
I thank God that I have become, <br>
wholeheartedly obedient to the teachings, <br>
which were given by the prophets.<br>
Help us to strive after,  <br>
for the purpose of honoring, <br>
you in all things.<br>
I hear your voice, I will follow you, O Lord,<br>
In your word, you give eternal life,<br>
you promise I shall never perish.<br>
In Jesus' name,<br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
