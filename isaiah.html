<h1> Isaiah 41:11-16  </h1>


<p>
<pre>
Behold, all they  
that were incensed(very angry) 
against thee shall be ashamed 
and confounded: 
they shall be as nothing; 
and they that strive(attempt) 
with thee shall perish.
Thou shalt seek them, 
and shalt not find them, 
even them that contended with thee: 
they that war against thee 
shall be as nothing, 
and as a thing of nought.
For I the LORD thy God 
will hold thy right hand, 
saying unto thee, Fear not; 
I will help thee.
Fear not, thou worm Jacob, 
and ye men of Israel; 
I will help thee, saith the LORD, 
and thy redeemer, 
the Holy One of Israel.
Behold, I will make thee 
a new sharp threshing 
instrument having teeth: 
thou shalt thresh the mountains, 
and beat them small, 
and shalt make the hills as chaff.
Thou shalt fan them, 
and the wind shall carry them away, 
and the whirlwind shall scatter them: 
thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, 
shalt thou glory in the Holy One of Israel.
