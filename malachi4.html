<h1>Malachi 4:1</h1>


<p>
1 For, behold, the day cometh, <br>
that shall burn as an oven; <br>
and all the  proud, yea, <br>
and all that do wickedly, <br>
shall be stubble:<br> 
and the day that cometh, <br>
shall burn them up,<br>
saith the LORD of hosts,<br> 
that it shall leave, <br>
them neither root nor branch.<br>

 2 But unto you,<br>
that fear my name, <br>
shall the Son of righteousness,<br>
arise with healing in his wings; <br>
and ye shall go forth,<br> 
and grow up as calves of the stall.<br>

3 And ye shall tread, <br>
down the wicked; <br>
for they shall be ashes, <br>
under the soles of your feet, <br>
in the day that I shall do this,<br> 
]saith the LORD of hosts.<br>

 1 Certainly the day is coming! <br>
It will burn like a furnace.<br> 
All arrogant people, <br>
and all evildoers, <br>
will be ⌞like⌟ straw.<br>  
The day that is coming, <br>
will burn them up completely,<br> 
says the LORD of Armies.<br>
It won’t leave a single root or branch.<br>

  2  The Sun of Righteousness, <br>
will rise with healing in his wings,<br> 
for you people who fear my name. <br>
You will go out and leap, <br>
like calves let out of a stall.<br>

  3  You will trample on wicked people, <br>
because on the day I act, <br>
they will be ashes, <br>
under the soles of your feet, <br>
says the LORD of Armies.<br>
