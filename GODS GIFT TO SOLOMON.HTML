<h1>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon,<br> 
    in a dream at night.<br> 
    He said, “What can I give you?”
</h1>


<p>
 6  Solomon responded, “You’ve shown great love to my father David,<br> 
     who was your servant. He lived in your presence with truth,<br>  
     righteousness, and commitment. <br> 
     And you continued to show him your great love,<br>  
     by giving him a son to sit on his throne today.<br> 

 7  “LORD my God, although I’m young and inexperienced, <br> 
     you’ve made me king in place of my father David.<br> 

 8  I’m among your people whom you have chosen. <br> 
    They are too numerous to count or record.<br> 

 9  "Give me a heart that listens, <br> 
    so that I can judge your people,<br>  
    and tell the difference between good and evil. <br> 
    After all, who can judge this great people of yours?”<br> 

 10  The LORD  * was pleased that Solomon asked for this.<br> 

 11  God replied, “You’ve asked for this and not for a long life, <br> 
     or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies. <br> 
     Instead, you’ve asked for understanding so that you can do what is right.<br> 

 12  So I’m going to do what you’ve asked.<br>  
     I’m giving you a wise and understanding, <br> 
     heart so that there will never be anyone like you.<br> 

 13  I’m also giving you what you haven’t asked for,<br> 
     —riches and honor—so that no other king, <br> 
     will be like you as long as you live.<br> 

 14  And if you follow me and obey my laws,<br>  
     and commandments as your father David did, <br>  
     then I will also give you a long life.<br> 
  
  AMEN!
