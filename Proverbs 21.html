<h1>Proverbs 21:29</h1>


<p>

God you are my guide,<br>
in all things, <br>
grant me the courage of honesty. <br>
-A wicked man hardeneth his face: -<br>
Let me confess to my errors, <br>
and seek to amend my ways.<br> 
-but as for the upright, <br>
he directeth his way.-<br>
The wicked or the weak. <br>
will put up a front. <br>
to cover their. <br>
crimes or transgressions, <br>
Behind the sweetest of smiles. <br>
may lurk the most devastating characters.<br> 
Let me not hide or deceive others,<br> 
but act in accordance with your Law. <br>
God knows the truth,<br>
even if people may be fooled.<br>
For I trust in your mercy Lord, <br>
and know that justice is yours, <br>
Amen.<br>
