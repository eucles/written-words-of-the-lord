<h1>Journey of  Wisdom in 4 steps</h1>



<p>



1-Fear God. <br>
Solomon says the fear <br>
of the Lord <br>
is the beginning of wisdom (see Proverbs 9:10). ...<br>
2-Desire Wisdom. The second step <br>
to getting wisdom <br>
is to desire it with all our heart. ...<br>
3-Pray for Wisdom. ...<br>
4-Study God's Word daily <br>
as if seeking for hidden treasure <br>

Wisdom is the path <br>
of accepting reality <br>
and walking according <br>
to the parameters <br>
set in place by God.<br>

By seeing and adopting <br>
God’s perspective, <br>
we have allowed wisdom <br>
to enter our heart. <br>
The deep knowledge of truth, <br>
and the willingness <br>
to see reality <br>
becomes pleasant to our soul. <br>
When we learn to walk in wisdom, <br>
we learn to embrace reality, <br>
and see it as something delightful. <br>
This comes from God, <br>
but to gain the full benefit <br>
we must allow it to enter <br>
into our hearts and transform <br>
how we think, perceive, and behave in this world.<br>
Walking in reality is something <br>
we must learn; it is an acquired taste, <br>
but in time becomes delicious to our palate.<br>

 discretion will guard <br>
 and understanding <br>
 will watch over you, <br>
 he is not forgetting <br>
 that these two attributes <br>
 only come into a person’s life <br>
 through God’s initiation and our acceptance.<br> Wisdom itself is the crossroad <br>
 between God’s truth and our choices. <br>
 We hear, receive, understand, <br>
 embrace and practice. <br>
 This is the path, the journey of wisdom.<br>

Wisdom requires deliberate intentionality(on <br> purpose). <br>
It doesn’t “just happen.” <br>
All wisdom is readily available. <br>
God puts it at our fingertips. <br>
But we have to listen, pursue, <br>
see through God’s eyes, <br>
and adapt to see God’s ways <br>
rather than our ways. <br>
As we do this, and act upon <br>
the insights of wisdom, <br>
we become wise and in doing so <br>
we find fulfillment of our purpose.<br>

Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
I praise You for Your infinite wisdom ,<br>
that is abundantly evident ,<br>
in all that You do.<br> 
You are the essence of wisdom, <br>
and the source of it. <br>
Whereas You are abounding 
in wisdom, I am lacking.<br>
Please help me to grow ,<br>
in wisdom as I increase ,<br>
in my knowledge and fear of You. <br>
By Your Spirit, please increase my depth ,<br>
of insight as I study Your Word. <br>
Hold me back from leaning ,<br>
on my own understanding,<br>
and make me willing to be counted foolish ,<br>
by the world, for then I will have begun ,<br>
to display godly wisdom.<br>
It’s in the name of my Savior, <br>
Jesus Christ, that I pray. <br>
Amen. <br>
