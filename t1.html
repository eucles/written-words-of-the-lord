<h1>The Theophany</h1>


  <p>“The Great Holy One will come forth from his dwelling,<br>
 and the eternal God will tread from thence upon Mount Sinai."<br>
 He will appear with his army,<br>
 he will appear with his mighty host from the heaven of heavens.<br>
 All the watchers will fear and shake, and those who are hiding in all the ends of the earth will sing.<br>
 All the ends of the earth will be shaken,<br>
 and trembling and great fear will seize them (the watchers) <br>
 unto the ends of the earth.<br>
 The high mountains will be shaken and fall and break apart,<br>
 and the high hills will be made low and melt like wax <br>
 before the fire.<br>
 The earth will be wholly rent asunder,<br>
 and everything on the earth will perish,<br>
 and there will be judgment on all. With the righteous he will make peace,<br>
 and over the chosen there will be protection,<br>
 and upon them will be mercy.<br>
 They will all be God’s,<br>
 and he will grant them his good pleasure.<br>
 He will bless (them) all,<br>
 and he will help (them) all.<br>
 Light will shine upon them,<br>
 and he will make peace with them.<br>
 Look, he comes with the myriads of his holy ones,<br>
 to execute judgment on all,<br>
 and to destroy all the wicked,<br>
 and to convict all humanity<br>
 for all the wicked deeds that they have done,<br>
 and the proud and hard words that wicked sinners<br>
 spoke against him.<br>
