<h1> Proverbs 9: 1 - 11 ( easy English) </h1>

<p>


1  Wisdom is the name of the woman, <br>
who has built her house. <br>
And she has made it beautiful.<br>
<br>
 2  She has prepared her meat, <br>
 and she has mixed her *wine. <br>
 Also, she has made her table ready.<br>
<br>
 3  She has sent her servants, <br>
 to shout out from, <br>
 the highest places in the town,<br>
<br>
 4  ‘Come in, you people, <br>
 who are not *wise yet. <br>
 Come in you people who are *fools.<br>
<br>
 5  Come, eat my food. <br>
 Drink the *wine that I have mixed.<br>
<br>
 6  Leave the ways of *fools. <br>
 If you do, you will continue to live. <br>
 Do what *wise people do.’<br>
<br>
 7  Some people think that they are great. <br>
 You may tell them that, <br>
 they should not say bad words. <br>
 But they will say bad things about you. <br>
 Do not tell a bad man that he is wrong. <br>
 If you do, he will attack you.<br>
<br>
 8  Do not tell these people, <br>
 that they are wrong. <br>
 If you do, they will *hate you. <br>
 You can tell a *wise man, <br>
 that he is wrong. <br>
 If you do, he will love you.<br>
<br>
 9  Anything that you say, <br>
 to *wise men will, <br>
 cause them to be more *wise. <br>
 Good men will learn, <br>
 whatever you tell them.<br>
<br>
 10  To be afraid of the *Lord, <br>
 is the beginning of *wisdom. <br>
 If you know the *Holy God, <br>
 you will be *wise.<br>
<br>
 11  *Wisdom will give to you, <br>
 more days and even, <br>
 more years of life.<br>
