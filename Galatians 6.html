<h1> Galatians 6:2 </h1>


<p>

Heavenly Father, It is scriptured <br>
Bear ye one another's burdens,<br>
Forgive me, merciful Lord,<br>
because I have often <br>
done things for my own benefit <br>
rather than thinking of others.<br>
I know that I  should <br>
be nice to all people <br>
because everyone is fighting <br>
a battle that we each <br>
have no knowledge about.<br>
Sometimes, I am so selfish <br>
that I refuse to help those <br>
that need it most <br>
because I feel it would <br>
take too much of my own time. <br>
so to fulfil the law of Christ.<br>
I will learn to carry<br> 
Others burdens as my own, <br>
then I will help them<br>
 as if you were <br>
 helping me, Lord.<br>
 Help me to be more like you Lord, <br>
 O Lord, may everything <br>
 I do be acceptable in thy sight. <br>
 In Jesus' name.<br>
 I pray<br>
 Amen.<br>
