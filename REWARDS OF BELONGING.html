<p>


Heavenly Father; <br>
The most High,   <br>
And Lofty One..  <br>
One in the One,  <br>
Supreme Deity;  <br>
Lord, I can never.. <br> 
Thank you enough,  <br>
“For the blood You shed for me”  <br>  
Your sacrifice,  Made me,   <br>
A part, Of your, Family…  <br>
A way to commune with God---  <br>
“Something that would,   <br>
Have been lost.   <br>
To me, forever, <br>
Thank you, For loving me, <br>
Even at  my lowest, <br> 
Most sinful nature.   <br>
Help  me to never take,   <br>
Your sacrifice: For granted…   <br>
In Jesus' name, The wonderful counselor,   <br>
The prince  of peace,  <br> 
Emanuel, Emanuel;   <br>
His Spirit of Truth;  <br>
The  divine teacher;   <br>
The  Great Comforter;   <br>
The Mighty Holy Ghost;   <br>
I give thanks,  <br>
To the Most High:  <br>
His Son, for acknowledgement,   <br>
In answering my prayers. <br>  
AMEN!   <br>
