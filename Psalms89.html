<h1>Psalms 89:13-18 </h1>


<p>
Thou hast a mighty arm:<br> 
strong is thy hand, <br> 
and high is thy right hand.<br> 
Justice and judgment, <br> 
are the habitation, <br> 
of thy throne: <br> 
mercy and truth, <br> 
shall go before thy face.<br> 
Blessed is the people, <br> 
that know the joyful sound: <br> 
they shall walk, O LORD, <br> 
in the light of thy countenance.<br> 
In thy name shall, <br> 
they rejoice all the day: <br> 
and in thy righteousness, <br> 
shall they be exalted.<br> 
 thou art the glory, <br> 
of their strength: <br> 
and in thy favour our horn. <br> 
shall be exalted.<br> 
For the LORD is our defence; <br> 
and the Holy One of Israel is our king.<br>
