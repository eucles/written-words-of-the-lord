<h1> Matthew 17:5 </h1>


<p>

God, You are amazing! <br>
-While he yet spake,(Peter)<br>
 behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:-
"Jesus is the Son of God." <br>
He was with God, <br>
the Father in the beginning. <br>
He lives in perfect harmony, <br>
and unity with God the Father, <br>
and the Holy Spirit.<br>
-behold a voice out of the cloud, <br>
which said, This is my beloved Son, <br>
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.-<br>
The three are one God in three persons. <br>
Jesus is the Word of God made flesh. <br>
As a human, He dwelt among us.<br>
Jesus was fully human and fully God,<br>
He exist in three persons, <br>
and yet he is one. <br>
He lives in communion, <br>
with the Spirit and Son, <br>
and he chose to allow, <br>
humans to commune with him. <br>
"This is my Son", the voice said. ‘<br>
I love him and he makes me, <br>
very happy. Listen to him.<br>
God sent Jesus so that, <br>
He could make it so, <br>
we can come before You. <br>
I worship You – Father, Son, <br>
and Holy Spirit.<br>
God the Father, Son, <br>
and Holy Spirit - <br>
The Trinity is truly amazing. <br>
In Jesus' name. <br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
