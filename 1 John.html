<h1> 1 John 4:18 </h1>

<p>


Dear God, I am grateful, <br>
to be able to come to you, <br>
without fear whenever, <br>
I make a mistake or, <br>
fall short in any manner. <br>
-There is no fear in love; <br>
but perfect love casteth out fear:-<br>
God does not intend for us, <br>
to be afraid of coming to him, <br>
even when we make mistakes.<br>
Any person who knows, <br>
that God loves him will, <br>
not be afraid of God. <br>
This love causes us not to be afraid.<br>
Father, my sole intention, <br>
is to become a better person in you, <br>
-because fear hath torment. <br>
He that feareth is not made perfect in love.-<br>
if someone is afraid of God, <br>
he is not completely *trusting God.<br>
He is not completely *trusting, <br>
that God loves him.<br>
He simply requires us to turn to him,<br>
trust in him, and allow him to guide our lives. <br>
That is what God's love is. <br>
It is there to remove your fears, <br>
and build your confidence, <br>
in God and God alone.<br>
I am grateful for your patience, <br>
and your willingness, <br>
to help me grow. <br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray.<br> 
Amen.<br>
