<h1> PSALMS 63:1  </h1>


<p>
O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD, EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU; <BR>
MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR YOU IN A DRY AND WEARY LAND <BR>
WHERE THERE IS NO WATER<BR>



<pre>
After this, God's gonna perfect me, 
settle me, strengthen me, and then establish me!
So I'm making an informed decision 
to hold on! I'm going to hold on, 
to my faith, and to my dReams, 
knowing that everything God promised me, 
is getting ready to happen. 
My story isn't finished, so in everything I do today, 
I'm going to pursue God first. 
My pursuit of the master comes first! 
Pleasing Him with my life, has become my number one ambition, 
and living for Jesus has become my greatest joy! ]
So Father, I'm going to wait right here, 
in Your presence, until You change me, 
and make me better! I'm gonna stay right here, 
in this safe place, this peaceful place, un
til You finish what You started in me, 
and until You're satisfied with who I am, 
it's in Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
