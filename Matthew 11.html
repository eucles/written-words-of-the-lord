<h1>Matthew 11:29</h1>


<p>

Lord, thank you, <br>
for easing my burden, <br>
and granting me, <br>
the rest found within,<br>
I ask of Your, <br>
mercy and forgiveness. <br>
-Take my yoke upon you,-<br>
-and learn of me; -<br>
-for I am meek and lowly in heart:-<br>
Life is hard. <br>
The demands of work, <br>
parenthood, <br>
and all of our obligations, <br>
weigh us down. <br>
Imagine how crushing, <br>
the weight would be, <br>
if we had to toil to satisfy, <br>
God’s demands, too.<br>
Teach me to walk in, <br>
Your gentleness and grace,<br>
You said O'Lord, <br>
'Place my yoke  * <br>
over your shoulders, <br>
and learn from me, <br>
because I am gentle and humble,'<br>
-and ye shall find rest unto your souls.-<br>
Thank you, lord for sending, <br>
Jesus to bear the burden for us. <br>
When we take on the yoke, <br>
of working for His kingdom, <br>
we ironically find rest.<br>
Thank You for providing me, <br>
the strength to serve, <br>
You and for sending, <br>
Jesus to carry the weight,<br>
that should have been mine. <br>
As we walk with Jesus, <br>
he does the heavy lifting for us.<br>
"Then you will find rest for yourselves,<br>
because my yoke is easy, <br>
and my burden is light."<br>
In His gracious name, Jesus'<br>
I pray, <br>
Amen.<br>
