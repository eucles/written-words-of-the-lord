Lord Thy God, 
I thank you for your word.
In the scriptures,
three things will remain,
When all have passed away,
Faith-Hope-Charity.
In my lifespan that you have, 
planned out for me.
Please give me faith-
That is to know, 
that you exist and is,
Creator and ruler.
Over all things.
I ask oh Lord,
To grant me hope,
Which is the joyful,
And confident expectation.
Of eternal salvation.
Last but not least,
Heavenly father, teach 
And show me 
Your ways of Charity.
Give to me brotherly love,
Show me how to be, 
affectionate towards others,
To have goodwill toward others,
Grant me the understanding, 
of love benevolence,
-kindness toward others.
And of these three 
- charity-
Is the best 
please allow your 
Love to shine 
forth through me 
for all to see.
In Jesus name,
I pray, Amen.
