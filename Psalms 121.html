<h1>Psalms 121:2</h1>

<p>


Dear God, I thank you, <br>
that my help comes from you. <br>
-I will lift up mine, <br>
eyes unto the hills, <br>
from whence cometh my help.-<br>
As Christians, we should never,<br>
forget that God is the source, <br>
of all of our help.<br>
-My help comes from the *LORD. <br>
He made the *heaven and the earth.-<br>
He will send us people and things, <br>
to help us but we shouldn't,  <br>
see the people as the source.<br>
They are just God's vessels, <br>
who are doing His work in our lives.<br>
In times of distress, <br>
no matter how overwhelmed, <br>
I may feel, I know that, <br>
I can trust in you, Lord. <br>
You are my guide, <br>
and my strength. <br>
You keep me when, <br>
the world tries to tear me apart. <br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
