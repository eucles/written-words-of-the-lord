<h1>Proverbs 29:25</h1>


<p>

Dear God, I thank you<br>
that I have no reason <br>
to fear or fret,<br>
because your peace <br>
is with me. <br>
"The fear of man bringeth <br>
a snare: but whoso putteth <br>
his trust in the LORD shall be safe."<br>
If you are afraid of other people <br>
you will never feel safe. <br>
But if you *trust the *Lord, <br>
he will keep you safe.<br>
Your love comforts me. <br>
God fills our hearts <br>
with peace and love, <br>
and fear cannot be anywhere <br>
where peace and love are present.<br>
Thank you, Lord, for leading me <br>
in a way I can be confident of. <br>
I never have to worry <br>
when my life is in your hands, Lord. <br> 
We are to put <br>
our trust in God; <br>
because His guidance <br>
will never give us a reason to fear.<br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
