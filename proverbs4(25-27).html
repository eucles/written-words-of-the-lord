<p>
 LET YOUR EYES LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; <br>
FIX YOUR GAZE DIRECTLY BEFORE YOU, <br>
GIVE CAREFUL THOUGHT TO THE PATH <br>
FOR YOUR FEET AND BE STEADFAST <br>
IN ALL YOUR WAYS. DO NOT TURN <br>
TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT;<br>
 KEEP YOUR FOOT FROM EVIL. <br>


<pre>
You've got God on your side, 
and you're filled with the Holy Spirit. 
The Spirit of the living God is on you, 
in you, and with you, this makes you unbeatable!
Today, you will not grow weary in doing well
I pray that you receive the work of the Holy Spirit in your life.
Always refuse to let the challenges 
of the season wear you down
I decree and declare you are strong. 
You are focused, you are unbreakable.
You are the one that God 
is using to restore 
credibility and significance to your family. 
I declare you're gonna be stronger! 
You're  gonna be wiser! 
You're gonna be 
who God has created you to be! 
You're gonna be better! 
You're gonna be bigger! 
You're gonna Be everything you dReamt of being!
And your "being", begins today!
it's in Jesus' name
I pray, Amen.
