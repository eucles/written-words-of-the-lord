<h1>Mark 6:49-50</h1>


<p>


LORD, You make mighty miracles. <br>
You do it with ease.  <br>
It is in Your nature to be miraculous. <br>
- When they saw him walking upon the sea, - <br>
-they supposed it had been a spirit, - <br>
-and cried out: - <br>
-For they all saw him, and were troubled.- <br>
You make simple moments amazing.  <br>
You can walk on water.  <br>
You can move mountains.  <br>
-Immediately you talked with them, - <br>
-and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: - <br>
-it is I; be not afraid.- <br>
Jesus is capable of doing anything.  <br>
Believe in His name,  <br>
and experience His greatness. <br>
Thank You for Your might,  <br>
and Your goodness.  <br>
I love to hear of Your mighty ways.  <br>
In Jesus' name.  <br>
Amen. <br>
