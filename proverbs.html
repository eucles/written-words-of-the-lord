<h1>Proverbs 9:10</h1>

<p>


Dear God, I pray <br>
that I never take <br>
your authority <br>
and your supremacy <br>
for granted; <br>
to do so, <br>
would be a <br>
terrible mistake <br>
on my part. <br>
Father, I thank you <br>
that with the assistance <br>
and guidance <br>
of the Holy Spirit, <br>
I will continue <br>
to revere you <br>
and uphold <br>
your sovereignty. <br>
There is no one like you, <br>
O Lord. <br>
There is no one <br>
who can rise<br> 
to stand against you. <br>
You are God, Almighty, <br>
and you are worthy <br>
of all praise. <br>
May my life <br>
be an expression <br>
of my reverence <br>
towards you, <br>
Heavenly Father. <br>
In the name of Jesusâ€™, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
