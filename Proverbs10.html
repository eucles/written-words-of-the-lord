<h1>Proverbs 10:2</h1>

<p>


Dear God, the world,<br> 
may be filled with people, <br>
who have attained their goods, <br>
through ill-gotten ways.<br>
-Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:-<br>
No matter how good or glorious, <br>
the wealth and possessions, <br>
of the wicked may look, <br>
it all means nothing.<br>
If you are not *honest, <br>
your money will not help you. <br>
It will all pass away, <br>
and the wicked, <br>
will be left to face, <br>
the consequences of their actions.<br>
- Righteousness delivereth from death.-<br>
Lord, my heart remains at peace. <br>
I choose not to envy them, <br>
because I know what, <br>
I possess is far better, <br>
than any earthly thing. <br>
The gift of salvation. <br>
You should live in the way, <br>
that God wants you to live. <br>
If you do that, <br>
it will save you from death.<br>
You are a child of God and,<br>
 God will always provide for you. <br>
 Most importantly, you are saved. <br>
 That is more important,<br>
 than anything in this world.<br>
Thank you for always, <br>
being there for me, Lord. <br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
