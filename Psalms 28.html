<h1> Psalms 28:1 </h1>

<p>


My God, my Rock!<br> 
I don’t know how much more, <br>
pain and anxiety I can stand.  <br>
-I am *praying to you for help. <br>
Do not turn your ears away from me.-<br>
Nobody understands me,<br>
Sometimes life can make us feel so alone. <br>
Our friends abandon us in times of crisis. <br>
We struggle with stress, <br>
and worry that nobody, <br>
seems to understand. <br>
Where do we turn when we’re alone?<br>
-If you hide your answer from me, <br>
I will be as those people, <br>
that go down into the pit.-<br>
Sometimes God uses these, <br>
difficult times to remind us, <br>
He is still our Rock and our hope. <br>
Only God is faithful, <br>
in all circumstances.<br>
You are my only hope. <br>
Help me to find, <br>
my footing on Your rock. <br>
Help me to trust You, <br>
even when You are silent. <br>
Teach me to depend, <br>
on You alone. <br>
In Jesus’ name, <br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
