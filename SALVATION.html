<h1> SALVATION </h1>

<p>


I will greatly rejoice,<br>  
In the Lord.<br>    
I am truly grateful, <br>   
For this gift,<br>    
Of salvation.  <br>  
My soul shall be,  <br>  
Joyful in my God.  <br>  
I thank you, <br>  
For your Son,  <br>  
Jesus Christ.  <br>  
For he has clothed me,  <br>  
With the garments, <br>   
Of salvation. <br>   
Who has saved me,  <br>  
Cleanse me,  <br>  
And made me new, <br>   
Before you.<br>    
He hath covered me,<br>    
With the robe of righteousness.<br>    
I am free,  From the weight,  <br>  
Of my old life. <br>   
As a bridegroom,  <br>  
Decketh himself,<br>   
With ornaments. <br>  
I can live,  Happily,  <br>  
In this new life .  <br>  
Amen .<br>
