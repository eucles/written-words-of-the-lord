<h1> Repentance</h1>

<p>


Heavenly Father: <br> 
The Most High,  <br>
And Lofty One… <br>
Supreme Being… <br> 
I give praise,  <br>
To you with,  <br>
Thankfulness;  <br>
That you are God;  Of All:.. <br> 
Your words are, <br> 
Always kind,  <br>
Always right,  <br>
Always willing,  <br>
To do what’s justifiable for me… <br> 
Please forgive my sins,  <br>
That are in my heart…  <br>
I pray for your forgiveness. <br>
 I understand the door, <br> 
Is always open, <br>
At your house. <br> 
There I can confess , <br>
That you will be  Faithful to hear me..  <br>
Forgive me O’lord,  <br>
For the sins - I’m coherent of;  <br>
And the sins… that are incoherent…  <br>
In the name of Jesus’  I pray:- <br>
The wonderful counselor, <br> 
The Prince of Peace:-<br>
Emanuel; Emanuel.  <br>
His Spirit of Truth:-<br>
The Divine Teacher. <br> 
The Mighty Holy Spirit:… <br> 
I ask of your grace , <br>
Most High, and your Son:  <br>
For acknowledgement, <br> 
For answering my prayer-<br>
AMEN.<br>
