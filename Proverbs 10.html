<h1>Proverbs 10:7</h1>

<p>


Dear God, I pray that <br>
I will always be kind <br>
in my ways to everyone <br>
around me. <br>
-The memory of the righteous is blessed;-<br>
People who strive<br>
to be good and righteous <br>
will always be <br>
remembered with fondness.<br>
I desire that when <br>
I leave this earth, <br>
I will be remembered <br>
for being someone <br>
who expressed your love <br>
not someone who inflicted <br>
pain on others. <br>
the memory of people <br>
who have lived their lives <br>
hurting people, <br>
will never be a good one.<br>
-the name of the wicked shall rot.-<br>
May I be known for being peaceful <br>
and loving and always ready to help, <br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
