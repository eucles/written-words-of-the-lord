<h1>Job 8:9</h1>


<p>

LORD, I will serve You, <br>
with the short time, <br>
on earth I have. <br>
For we are just, <br>
a glimpse of yesterday,<br>
and know nothing,<br>
Often, we think, <br>
we know everything.<br>
But this is not so.<br>
I know my life is like a vapor, <br>
â€“ here today and gone tomorrow. <br>
I commit to You, <br>
all my days You give me. <br>
Let Your will, <br>
be done in my life. <br>
I will spend, <br>
my whole life to serve You. <br>
because our days upon, <br>
earth are just a shadow:<br>
You are a good God. <br>
Our days on earth are short, <br>
and we will soon be forgotten. <br>
Serve the LORD with all your days, <br>
because everything else,<br> 
will just pass away. <br>
You are worthy of all my days. <br>
Thank You for seeking me. <br>
In Jesus' name. <br>
I pray,<br>
Amen.<br>
