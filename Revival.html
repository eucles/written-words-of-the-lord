<h1>Revival</h1>


<p>


"Dear Father, Please forgive, <br>
the society I live in. <br>
Father, I live in a world, <br>
of increasing postmodern thought, <br>
and self-love. <br>
Please bring a revival to my area, <br>
that people would repent, <br>
of the things they do, <br>
that displease you,<br>
and have their heart turned to you. <br>
Help me take a part in that revival, <br>
to speak when I should speak, <br>
and to stand up, <br>
when others are tempted to sit back. <br>
I am thankful that you can move <br>
in even the darkest of places. <br>
Give me the eyes to see You. <br>
In Jesus's name, <br>
I pray, <br>
Amen.<br>
