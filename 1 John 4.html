<h1>1 John 4:7</h1>

<p>



Dear God, I ask that,<br> 
in everything I do, <br>
may I express the love ,<br>
you have for your children ,,<br>
and for the world. ,<br>
We are also called ,<br>
to be loving towards ,<br>
people of the world ,<br>
because it is our love ,<br>
that will be an example ,<br>
of God's love for them.<br>
-Beloved, let us love one another: <br>
for love is of God;-<br>
May I never be tempted ,<br>
to become judgmental ,<br>
towards anyone; <br>
As Christians, we are called ,<br>
to be loving towards ,<br>
our brothers and sisters in Christ,<br>
-every one that loveth ,<br>
is born of God, and knoweth God.-<br>
our bond is what strengthens our faith.<br>
I ask that I will only ,<br>
be concerned with loving ,<br>
everyone around me. <br>
In Jesus' name, <br>
I pray. <br>
Amen.<br>
