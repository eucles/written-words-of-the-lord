<h1>  ARAMIC PRAYERS </h1>


<p>
<pre>
Our Father who art in heaven:
O Birther! Father-Mother of the Cosmos, 
you create all that moves in light.
Hallowed be thy name
Focus your light within us — 
make it useful: 
as the rays of a beacon show the way.
Thy kingdom come
Unite our “I can” to yours, 
so that we walk as 
kings and queens with every creature.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Create in me a divine cooperation —
from many selves, one voice, one action.
Give us this day our daily bread
Grant what we need each day in bread and insight.
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
Forgive our hidden past, 
the secret shames, 
as we consistently forgive what others hide.
And lead us not into temptation 
but deliver us from evil
Deceived neither by the outer nor the inner — 
free us to walk your path with joy.
For Thine is the kingdom, 
and the power, and the glory, forever. 
From you is born all ruling will, 
the power and life to do, 
the song that beautifies all from age to age it renews. 
Amen.
