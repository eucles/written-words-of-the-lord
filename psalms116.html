<h1>psalms 116:1-11</h1>


<p>
I love the LORD, <br>
because he hath heard,  <br>
my voice and my supplications. <br>
Because he hath,  <br>
inclined his ear unto me,  <br>
therefore will I call,  <br>
upon him as long as I live. <br>
The sorrows of death,  <br>
compassed me,  <br>
and the pains of hell,  <br>
gat hold upon me:  <br>
I found trouble and sorrow. <br>
Then called I upon the name,  <br>
of the LORD; O LORD,  <br>
I beseech thee, deliver my soul. <br>
Gracious is the LORD,  <br>
and righteous; yea,  <br>
our God is merciful. <br>
The LORD preserveth the simple:  <br>
I was brought low,  <br>
and he helped me. <br>
Return unto thy rest, O my soul;  <br>
for the LORD hath,  <br>
dealt bountifully with thee. <br>
For thou hast delivered,  <br>
my soul from death,  <br>
mine eyes from tears,  <br>
and my feet from falling. <br>
I will walk before the LORD,  <br>
in the land of the living. <br>
Amen. <br>
