<h1>Yahweh</h1>


<p>


O Lord, you are the omni-<br>
 you are everywhere- present God. <br>
The heaven of heavens <br>
cannot contain you,<br>
 no not the entirety <br>
of the created universe. <br>
The universe is vast <br>
beyond our ability to comprehend, <br>
yet as a created thing, <br>
we know it must have its limits. <br>
But you are infinite. <br>
Your divine nature is beyond <br>
our ability to comprehend, <br>
and we feel our smallness. <br>
But we also know you dwell in us, <br>
your people, and hold intimate communion <br>
with our spirits every day. <br>
Amen.<br>
